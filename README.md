# 3D printable modding parts for the Romet RCR (and others...)
These are models and slicer-ready STLs for Romet RCR modding parts:

* A cap for the steering head nut (no residual water in the hole anymore)
* A gear shift rubber XL (gives a little bit better and more direct shift)
* A visor for the instrument panel (a little bit better reading at bright sunlight)

The parts should fit to all brands identically constructed like the ZHEJANG CHANGLING (BENDA) BD125-2 (2019/2020 model with digital instrument panel):

* Romet RCR 125 (Poland)
* LuXXon Twinrider 125 (Germany)
* Bexx 125 Funrider (France)
* Mitt 125 MB EFI (Spain)
* AJS Highway Star 125 (UK)

I printed the parts with black TPU with 0,2mm layer height/100% infill/0,4mm nozzle.
The cap and the gear shift rubber were printed with FFFworld Flexismart TPU (more flexible, less glossy), the visor is printed with ERYONE TPU (less flexible, more glossy).

The part is modeled with [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).
